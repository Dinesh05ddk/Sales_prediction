# Sales Forecasting Using Regression

## Overview

This project aims to predict future sales using regression techniques in machine learning. By analyzing historical sales data along with relevant features, such as time, seasonality, and marketing efforts, the model forecasts future sales figures. This README provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for replicating the results.

## Introduction

Sales forecasting is a critical aspect of business planning and strategy. By accurately predicting future sales, companies can make informed decisions regarding inventory management, resource allocation, and revenue projections. This project leverages regression models to forecast sales based on historical data and other relevant factors.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical sales data, including features such as:

- Date
- Sales figures
- Marketing expenditures
- Seasonality indicators
- Economic factors (if applicable)

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and engineer additional relevant features for model training.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Dinesh05ddk/Sales_prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd sales-forecasting
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
This project is done in Jupyter Notebook
```
pip install lightgbm
```

## Usage

Once the project and dependencies are installed,


Replace `data/sales_data.csv` with the path to your dataset and `data/new_data.csv` with the path to new data for prediction.

## Results

The performance of the sales forecasting model is evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. The model's predictions are compared against actual sales figures to assess its accuracy and reliability.
